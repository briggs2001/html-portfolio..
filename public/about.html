<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Briggs Roland Emmanuel</p>
<p>I’m a builder at heart — from composing dynamic rhythms as a drummer to developing robust code and designing modern, responsive websites. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology, bringing ideas to life through both sound and software.</p>

<p>I’m a passionate creator who thrives on bringing new ideas to life — whether I’m developing software, designing websites, playing drums, or exploring game worlds. I’m deeply inspired by creativity, culture, and connection, with a love for good food, fresh perspectives, and meaningful experiences both on and offline.</p>
